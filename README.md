# ScarnesDice
Android application made as part of the Applied Computer Science with Android Course

This application implements the Scarnes Dice game.

As explained on the Applied CS with Android website (https://appliedcsskills.withgoogle.com/),
'''
  Scarneâ€™s Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling a die and then:

    if they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn
    if they roll a 2 to 6:
        add the rolled value to their points
        choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn

  The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
 '''
 
 I have implemented the additional extension which adds support for playing the game upto 100 points, declaring a winner and starting a new game.
